## Photo Requirements

### What Makes a Good Photo

✅ **Do:**
- Take photos in good lighting
- Make sure the child's face is clearly visible
- Include photos of the child at school or doing activities
- Take recent photos (from the current month)

❌ **Don't:**
- Use blurry or dark photos
- Include photos that show sensitive locations
- Use old photos from previous months
- Include other children prominently (unless they're siblings in the same program)

### Technical Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| File format | JPG or PNG |
| File size | Under 10MB per photo |
| Quantity | 1-3 photos per update |

### Photo Tips

1. **Natural light** works best - take photos outdoors or near windows
2. **Eye level** - crouch down to take photos at the child's level
3. **Activity shots** - photos of children reading, playing, or learning are engaging
4. **School uniform** - if the child wears one, include at least one photo in uniform

---

## Writing the Narrative

The narrative is a short message that goes directly to the sponsor. It should feel personal and specific to this child.

### Guidelines

| Guideline | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Length | 60-900 characters (about 1-3 sentences) |
| Tone | Positive and warm |
| Content | Specific to this child, not generic |

### Good Example

> "Sarah has been doing wonderfully this month! She received top marks in her mathematics exam and was chosen to represent her class in the spelling competition. She often asks about her sponsor and draws pictures to include with her letters."

### What NOT to Write

❌ "The child is doing well." (Too generic)
❌ Medical diagnoses or detailed health information
❌ Family financial problems
❌ Full names of family members
❌ Specific addresses or locations

### Positive Highlight

One sentence about something good from the month:

> "James was selected as class monitor this month!"

> "Mary learned to ride a bicycle with help from her older sister."

### Challenge (Optional)

If relevant, note one challenge:

> "Adjusting to a new classroom after school renovations."

> "Recovering from a mild cold that kept her home for a few days."

## Deadlines

### Monthly Schedule

| Date | What Happens |

### Tips to Stay on Track

3. **Check your email** - Reminder emails tell you exactly which children are missing updates

## Common Questions

### "What if a child is absent when I visit?"

Submit what you can based on information from teachers or guardians. Note in the narrative that you didn't see the child directly. Try to visit again before the deadline.

### "What if I already submitted an update but made a mistake?"

Contact `admin@beanumber.org` immediately. They can request a correction before the update is published to the sponsor.

### "What if a child has left the program?"

Do not submit an update. Contact `admin@beanumber.org` to update the child's status in the system.

### "What if I can't get photos this month?"

Photos are required. If there's an exceptional circumstance preventing photos, contact `admin@beanumber.org` before the deadline to discuss.

### "What if the form isn't working?"

1. Try refreshing the page
2. Try a different browser
3. Check your internet connection
4. If problems continue, email `admin@beanumber.org` with details about the error

### "What if I have many children to update?"

Submit one form per child. You can submit updates throughout the month as you complete visits - you don't have to do them all at once.

### "What language should I write in?"

Write narratives in English. If you need to include a quote from the child in their native language, include an English translation.
