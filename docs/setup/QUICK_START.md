# Quick Start Guide - Be A Number Improvements

## 🚀 30-Minute Security Deploy (Do This First!)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Generate Admin Token
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### Step 3: Add to Vercel Environment Variables
Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables

Add:
```
ADMIN_API_TOKEN=<paste-the-token-from-step-2>
```

### Step 4: Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3001/sponsor/login

Try logging in with test credentials.

### Step 5: Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add security improvements and fix login issue"
git push origin main
```

**Done!** ✅ Login is fixed and admin endpoint is secured.

---

## 📋 What Just Got Fixed

1. ✅ **Login redirect issue** - Now works correctly
2. ✅ **Rate limiting** - Prevents brute force attacks (5 attempts/15min)
3. ✅ **Input validation** - Prevents injection attacks
4. ✅ **Logging** - Can debug issues easily
5. ✅ **Error handling** - Better error messages for users
6. ✅ **Admin security** - Endpoint requires authentication

## 📚 Next Steps (Optional, but Recommended)

### Refactor Remaining Routes (2-4 hours)

Follow the **complete code examples** in `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`:

1. [30 min] `/api/sponsor/updates` - Dashboard data
2. [30 min] `/api/sponsor/request-update` - Update requests
3. [15 min] `/api/sponsor/logout` - Logout
4. [45 min] `/api/create-checkout` - Donations
5. [45 min] `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Payment processing

Each section has **complete, copy-paste-ready code**.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module" errors

```

### Login still not working
1. Check Vercel logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
